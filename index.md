I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of applied artificial intelligence and a member of [Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab](dsail.skku.edu) at Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

My research interests include computational social science and human-center AI. More specifically, I am interested in developing and applying machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems (e.g., mental health problems and social issues).
